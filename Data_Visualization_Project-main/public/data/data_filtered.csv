One incendiary device was placed in a recycling dumpster at the southwest corner of the ranger station, and the second was planted on the outside of one of the walls of the station, causing an estimated $3,316,150 in damages to replace the building, and $1,758,039 for the contents, for a total loss of $5,074,189, in addition to a vast amount of lost research material.

The same day, a caller phoned the KSL radio station, claiming responsibility for the incident in the name of ALF, and a second call was made to Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade, also claiming the incident in the name of animal rights activists, but there was no specific reference to a person or group.  The perpetrators, Alexander David Slack, Clinton Colby Ellerman, Douglas Joshua Ellerman, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop, were arrested and indicted for their involvement in the incident and an alleged earlier attempt to bomb the co-op, which was aborted when they saw police presence.  After a trial, Sean Albert Gautschy,  Adam Troy Peace, and Andrew Bishop were acquitted, while Clinton Ellerman was sentenced to 5 years in prison, Douglas Ellerman to 7 years (which was later reduced by 13 months);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Raymond Kodiak Sandoval sent a pipe bomb to an environmentalist organization in March 1999 (199903200009).  Sandoval claimed that he did it to protest the policies of environmentalists who attempted to pass legislation which would kick poor Hispanics off of their land in northern New Mexico.  Although he pled guilty for the forest fire in 2003, he maintained that he was not the perpetrator and only admitted his guilt so that he would not face a possible sentence of 100 years in prison if convicted.;"Ben Neary, ""Sandoval: Bomb Was Purely 'Political,'"" Santa Fe New Mexican, October 11, 2003.";"Jeremy Pawloski, ""Militia Organizer Charged in 1999 Bomb Case,"" Albuquerque Journal, February 19, 2003.";"Monica Soto, ""Fire Rages in the Jemez,"" Santa Fe New Mexican, June 29, 1998.";Hewitt Project;-9;-9;0;-9;

In the first attack, which occurred at 8:46 am local time, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center Complex in New York City. Five hijackers belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Qa`ida, took control of the Boeing 767 aircraft on a flight originating from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, and destined for Los Angeles International Airport. On the airplane were 76 passengers, 11 crew members and 5 hijackers, all of whom died upon impact. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28 am local time after the South Tower had collapsed at 9:59 am local time.  A combined total of 2603 people died in the World Trade Center attacks, not counting the Flight 11 hijack victims.  Although not immediately known at the time of the attack, the Al-Qa`ida terrorist network, lead by Osama bin Laden, was responsible for all four of these attacks.

Lee entered the building at about 1:00pm waving a starter pistol (which was believed to be a gun at the time), with four crude explosive strapped to his body, two were propane cylinders with pipes attached that contained shotgun shells, and the other two were pipe bombs.  Lee also had a second starter pistol on him as he held the hostages for four hours as negotiators spoke with him. Lee was motivated by his disapproval of the Discovery network's television programming and in his manifesto on the internet, he laid out 11 demands for the network to change it's programming to focus on sterilization and infertility of humans rather than showcasing overpopulation, and Lee viewed the shows to be doing little to save the planet. When one hostage tried to run, Lee pointed a pistol at him, at which time Lee was shot to death by police snipers.  All three hostages were freed unharmed and the rest of the 1,900 employees of the building were able to escape unharmed as well.;1;1;1;0;;.;0;1;1;5;Hostage Taking (Barricade Incident);;.;;.;10;Journalists & Media;55;Television Journalist/Staff/Facility;Discovery Communications;Discovery Communications headquarters offices and employees;217;United States;;.;;.;;;;.;;.;;.;;;;.;Unaffiliated Individual(s);;;;;20202;;;;Lee opposed the programming of the Discovery channel, which he felt promoted overpopulation.
